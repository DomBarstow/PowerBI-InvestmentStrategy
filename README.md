# PowerBI-InvestmentStrategy

The data for this project was provided by the training provider JustIT, as part of their data analysis course.

Given the data, I was tasked with crafting a question that could be asked of the data, then creating a dashboard to answer that question.

The question I was led to is the following:
“What would be the investment strategy of the countries in order promote the products and to grow the segments?”

To answer this in the dashboard, I created 5 visuals:
-Sum of Profit
-Sales and COGS
-Sales by Segment and Country
-Sale Price by Country and Product
-Sales and PPUS by Product

Which are all filterable by Country or by Segment.
